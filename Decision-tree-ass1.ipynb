    "A decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions. Here's a detailed description of how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nodes: Points where the data is split. Each node represents a feature (attribute) in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Edges: Links between nodes that represent the outcome of a test on an attribute.\n",
    "3. Leaves: Terminal nodes that represent the class labels (predicted outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a Decision Tree Classifier Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Root Node Selection:\n",
    "The algorithm starts at the root node, which contains the entire dataset. The root node is selected by choosing the feature that best separates the data. This is often done using a metric like Gini impurity or information gain (derived from entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Splitting the Data:\n",
    "Gini Impurity: Measures the impurity of a node. A node is pure if all of its elements belong to a single class. The Gini impurity for a node is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Gini(D) = 1‚àí ‚àë(pi)^2\n",

    "      Entropy(D) = ‚àí‚àë pi log2(pi)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Partitioning: \n",
    "The dataset is split into subsets based on the chosen feature, and the process is repeated recursively for each subset. This creates branches of the tree. For each subset, the algorithm selects the best feature to split on, using the same criteria as the root node selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stopping Criteria:\n",

    "\n",
    "A predefined maximum tree depth is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of data points in a subset is smaller than a specified minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Leaf Nodes: \n",
    "Once the stopping criteria are met, a leaf node is created. The leaf node assigns a class label, usually the most frequent class among the data points in the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To make a prediction for a new data point:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the Root: Begin at the root node of the decision tree.\n",
    "2. Traverse the Tree: Move down the tree by following the edges based on the values of the data point's features. At each internal node, check the feature and follow the corresponding branch based on the feature's value.\n",
    "3. Reach a Leaf: Continue traversing until a leaf node is reached.\n",

    "Example of a Classification Problem where Recall is the Most Important Metric: Disease Screening\n",
    "Problem Context: In a disease screening scenario, the goal is to identify individuals who have a particular disease (e.g., cancer) from a large population. The primary concern is to ensure that as many cases of the disease as possible are identified so that those individuals can receive further testing and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Recall is Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Critical Health Implications: Failing to identify individuals who have the disease (false negatives) can have severe or even fatal consequences. Early detection is often crucial for effective treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Public Health: Missing cases can lead to wider spread of contagious diseases if infected individuals are not identified and treated promptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Treatment and Prognosis: For many diseases, early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment and survival. High recall ensures that most of the affected individuals are detected early.\n",

    "\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): Individuals who have the disease but are incorrectly identified as not having it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Recall Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing False Negatives: Ensuring that individuals with the disease are identified, even if it means some healthy individuals are incorrectly identified as having the disease (which can be addressed with further testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario and Metrics\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where a screening test is used on 10,000 individuals:\n",
